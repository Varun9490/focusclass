# FocusClass Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## üîß Student Cannot Connect to Teacher

### Quick Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Test Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   python test_connectivity.py <teacher_ip>
   ```
   Example: `python test_connectivity.py 172.168.1.197`

2. **Check Teacher Session Status**
   - Ensure teacher has clicked "Start Session"
   - Session details should be visible in teacher app
   - Look for logs: "Teacher server started" and "Session started"

3. **Verify Network Settings**
   - Both computers must be on the same network
   - Check IP address is correct (teacher shows IP in session details)
   - No VPN interference

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### ‚ùå "The semaphore timeout period has expired"
**Cause**: Network timeout - teacher not reachable
**Solutions**:
- Check teacher has started session
- Verify IP address is correct
- Test with `ping <teacher_ip>`
- Check Windows Firewall settings

#### ‚ùå "Cannot connect to host X.X.X.X:8080"
**Cause**: HTTP port blocked or teacher not running
**Solutions**:
- Teacher must click "Start Session" first
- Windows Firewall may be blocking ports 8080 and 8765
- Try temporarily disabling firewall for testing

#### ‚ùå "Connection timeout"
**Cause**: Network unreachable or firewall blocking
**Solutions**:
- Ensure both on same WiFi/network
- Check router settings if using different subnets
- Antivirus may be blocking connections

### Windows Firewall Configuration:

1. **Allow FocusClass through Windows Firewall**:
   - Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Windows Security
   - Firewall & network protection ‚Üí Allow an app through firewall
   - Add Python.exe or the specific FocusClass executable

2. **Open Required Ports**:
   - Port 8765 (WebSocket)
   - Port 8080 (HTTP API)

3. **Temporary Testing**:
   - Disable Windows Firewall temporarily
   - If connection works, add firewall exceptions

### Network Troubleshooting Commands:

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
ping <teacher_ip>

# Test specific ports
telnet <teacher_ip> 8080
telnet <teacher_ip> 8765

# Check local network configuration
ipconfig /all      # Windows
ifconfig           # Linux/Mac
```

### Teacher-Side Checklist:

- [ ] Session started successfully
- [ ] No errors in teacher logs
- [ ] Correct IP address displayed
- [ ] Ports 8080 and 8765 not blocked
- [ ] Windows Firewall allows connections

### Student-Side Checklist:

- [ ] Correct teacher IP address
- [ ] Correct session code and password
- [ ] On same network as teacher
- [ ] No VPN interfering
- [ ] Windows Firewall allows outbound connections

### Advanced Debugging:

1. **Check Teacher Logs**:
   Look for: "Teacher server started" and HTTP/WebSocket startup messages

2. **Check Student Logs**:
   Look for detailed connection attempt logs

3. **Network Analysis**:
   - Use `netstat -an` on teacher computer to verify ports are listening
   - Use network scanner tools to check port accessibility

### Quick Fix Checklist:

1. ‚úÖ Teacher clicked "Start Session"
2. ‚úÖ Both on same network
3. ‚úÖ Correct IP address
4. ‚úÖ Windows Firewall exceptions added
5. ‚úÖ No antivirus blocking
6. ‚úÖ No VPN interference

If all else fails, try connecting both computers via Ethernet cable for testing.
