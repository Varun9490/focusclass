- **Solution**: 
  - Improved UI layout with dedicated information cards
  - Added "Copy Session Details" and "View Details" buttons
  - Enhanced QR code display with proper sizing and scaling
  - Created detailed session information dialog

### 3. **Screen Sharing Functionality Fixed**

  - Added screen sharing control messages (start/stop)
  - Enhanced screen capture with proper frame transmission

### 4. **Missing Network Message Handlers**
- **Problem**: Multiple "No handler for message type" warnings
- **Solution**:
  - Added handlers for `welcome`, `screen_sharing`, and `screen_frame` messages
  - Implemented proper authentication handling in network manager
  - Enhanced message routing and error handling

### 5. **Window Sizing and Layout Issues**
- **Problem**: Welcome window and application UI not properly visible on different screen sizes
- **Solution**:
  - Increased minimum window sizes for better visibility
