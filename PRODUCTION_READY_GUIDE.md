## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Session details not visible"** ✅ FIXED
   - Session info now displays properly in information cards
   - Use Copy/View buttons to access details

2. **"Screen sharing not working"** ✅ FIXED

   - Check network connectivity between devices

3. **"No handler for message type" warnings** ✅ FIXED
   - All message handlers now properly implemented

4. **"CSS warnings"** ✅ FIXED
   - All unsupported CSS properties removed

### Dependency Issues
- **aiortc not available**: WebRTC features disabled, uses basic screen sharing
- **zeroconf not available**: Network discovery disabled, use manual connection
- **cv2 not available**: Advanced video features disabled, basic capture works

### Network Issues
- Ensure both devices on same network
- Check firewall/antivirus blocking
- Verify IP addresses are correct
- Try disabling Windows firewall temporarily for testing

## 🚨 Production Environment

### Security Considerations
- Run with administrator privileges for full functionality
- Session passwords are randomly generated and secure
- WebSocket connections use session-based authentication
- Network traffic stays on local LAN

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust screen sharing quality based on network
- Monitor CPU usage during screen capture
- Limit number of connected students (max 200)

### Monitoring & Logs
- Logs stored in `logs/` directory
- Teacher logs: `logs/teacher.log`
- Student logs: `logs/student.log`
- Launcher logs: `logs/launcher.log`
