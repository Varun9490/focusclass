# FocusClass - Production Ready Summary

## üéØ Issues Fixed and Improvements Made

### 1. **Screen Sharing Now Working** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Teacher started screen sharing but nothing was being transmitted to students.

**Solution**:
- Fixed screen capture implementation using MSS (Multiple Screen Shot) library
- Implemented proper base64 encoding/decoding for frame transmission
- Added real-time frame compression (JPEG with 70% quality, 75% scale)
- Increased frame rate from 2fps to 1fps for smoother sharing
- Enhanced frame transmission with width/height metadata
- Fixed student-side frame display with proper scaling

**Result**: Students now properly receive and display teacher's screen in real-time.

### 2. **Student Disconnection Notifications** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Teacher wasn't notified when students disconnected.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced WebSocket connection handling to capture real client IP addresses
- Added proper disconnection event handlers
- Implemented real-time student status updates
- Added violation log entries for disconnections
- Created toast notifications for connection/disconnection events

**Result**: Teacher now receives immediate notifications when students connect/disconnect with their real IP addresses.

### 3. **Focus Mode Violations Now Reported** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Students could switch tabs and teacher wasn't notified of violations.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced focus manager with comprehensive key combination blocking
- Added browser tab detection and monitoring
- Implemented registry-based restrictions (Task Manager, Registry Editor, CMD)
- Added real-time window monitoring and violation detection
- Enhanced violation reporting with detailed descriptions
- Implemented spam protection (max 1 violation per 2 seconds)

**Blocked Actions**:
- Alt+Tab (task switching)
- Windows key combinations
- Ctrl+Esc (Start menu)
- Ctrl+Shift+Esc (Task Manager)
- Alt+F4 (close window)
- F11 (fullscreen toggle)
- Ctrl+N (new window)
- Ctrl+T (new tab)
- Ctrl+W (close tab)
- Multiple browser tabs/windows

**Result**: Focus mode now effectively prevents tab switching and reports all violations to teacher.

### 4. **Session Details and QR Code Visibility** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Session details (code, password, IP, QR code) were not properly visible.

**Solution**:
- Redesigned session information layout with individual cards
- Enhanced QR code generation with complete session data
- Increased QR code size to 220x220 pixels
- Added "Copy Session Details" and "View Details" buttons
- Implemented proper session start/stop functionality
- Added real-time session status updates

**Result**: Session details are now clearly visible and easily accessible to teachers.

### 5. **Real Student IP Addresses** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Student IP addresses showed as 127.0.0.1 instead of real IPs.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced WebSocket connection handling to extract real client IP addresses
- Modified connection storage to include IP address metadata
- Updated message sending/broadcasting functions for new connection structure
- Added client information retrieval methods

**Result**: Teacher now sees real IP addresses of connected students.

### 6. **Student Actions Now Visible** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Actions for managing students (kick, monitor, focus) were not visible.

**Solution**:
- Redesigned student table with enhanced columns
- Added action buttons for each student:
  - üì¥ Kick Student (disconnect)
  - üëÅÔ∏è Monitor Student (view screen)
  - üéØ Toggle Focus Mode (individual control)
- Implemented real-time student status updates
- Added battery status, violation count, and keystroke monitoring
- Enhanced student list with color-coded status indicators

**Result**: Teachers can now manage individual students with visible action buttons.

### 7. **Welcome GUI Improvements** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Welcome GUI wasn't properly sized and not fullscreen.

**Solution**:
- Set window to maximized state by default
- Added fullscreen toggle functionality
- Improved button layout and spacing
- Enhanced responsive design
- Added fullscreen toggle button in footer

**Result**: Welcome window now opens maximized with fullscreen option.

### 8. **Enhanced Network Communication** ‚úÖ

- Fixed all missing message handlers
- Enhanced authentication with real IP capture
- Improved error handling and reconnection logic
- Added comprehensive logging and debugging
- Implemented proper session management
